I grew up tinkering with hardware and software - later I developed an interest in mathematics and machine learning.

While at university, I founded a delivery startup, did a research project applying machine learning to fluid dynamics, built an MEV bot, and interned at trading firms.

I recently graduated from Cambridge's Part III maths masters degree and am now working in London as a quant trader.
